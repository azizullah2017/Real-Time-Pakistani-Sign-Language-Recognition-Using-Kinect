\chapter{Future Recommendation}

This project is the minimum working example of a bigger, more universal and applied system that can be extensively used in many industry based and personal use application. This project serves the purpose in 4 sentences initially. Although the NLP problem is computationally infeasible, but if make an attempt to fit to some legitimate, small and limited scope application, we can cover most of the domain. \\

Currently system works for only single handed gesture. Develop a technique (most probably using RGB and Depth both) to segment both hands from the frame and then you can apply it universally to any sign.\\

Now we can extend this system by identifying a number of generally and frequently used sign language sentences. Prepare a dataset out of them by using at least two different signers. Feed into the system and retrain the model. Now attach (configure) this model to the prediction by configuring the file name and you are good to go. Use it in the environment.
